Dear Family and Friends, we are really excited about our big day and hope to see as many of you there as possible to help us celebrate! We’ve put this page together (well mainly Daniel) just to give you a few more details to try and make things a bit easier for you whilst making your arrangements to attend! We know some of you will be coming from far and wide so if you have any other questions that we haven’t covered, please just ask. It means so much to us to have our loved ones with us to share our special day and hopefully it will be as memorable for you as it most certainly will be for us!
